    Penne: Whoa, this place is filled with... stuff! Lots of stuff!
    Rigatoni: Of course it is. The Bodega is the only place to buy food and other goods in Timsville. 
    Penne: Seriously? Huh! I guess that makes sense, since Timsville is so small. 
    Rigatoni: Hm. Well, see what you can get out of the delivery man. I tried questioning him earlier, but I just know he's still hiding something. I'm going to take another look around.
    Penne: Sounds like a plan, Toni! 
    Rigatoni: I told you not to call me that.

    Penne: Toni, look at all this..! I think I'm onto something here!
    Rigatoni: ...Why did you bring me those things? I thought... I thought we were here to... What were we here to do again?
    Penne: Wha— What do you mean?! We're investigating Orzo's murder! I questioned Radiatore, and—
    Rigatoni: Oh, you shouldn't be questioning him! Radiatore's such a sweetheart, he'd never do anything wrong!
    Penne: That's not what you were saying a few minutes ago... (To herself) I think her forgetfulness is getting worse. We need to finish the investigation, stat!
