    Penne: Wh-whoa! This painting...it's so powerful! Is this what Tim really looks like?
    Penne: There's something written on the bottom. 
    Penne: "By the light that burns through the Tim, may the path to Salvation be revealed." 
    Penne: Hmmm...there seems to be something BEHIND this painting!
    Penne: The light that burns through reveals something...maybe this painting leads somewhere important!
    Nero: Please step away from the painting. It's extremely fragile.
    Penne: (Drat! Even if I wanted to investigate or do something to this painting, Nero won't let me.)
    Penne: (I should collect other pieces of evidence and question him more. While I investigate, maybe Nero will leave and give me an opportunity to do something here!)
<<elseif Check_Collected("Church_Candle") == false && Check_Read ("neroGone") == true>>
    Penne: There's definitely something behind this painting! 
    Penne: I can't seem to move it. This thing really won't budge...

    Penne: And there's only one way to find out...

            Penne: Maybe I shouldn't be burning things...
            Penne: Yet.

    Penne: (That can only mean he's hiding something, and this might help me later!)

    Penne: This is Nero's logbook of confessions. The entries from on the night Timsday are... about Orzo!
    
    Penne: Looks like he talked more about his strange dreams, and about having "a life before Timsville" and "doubts about the sanctity of Tim."
    Penne: According to this, Nero's advice was to pray and believe in Tim to guide him.
    Penne: ...The handwriting in this book looks really beautiful...and familiar...
    Penne: Wait a minute! The handwriting looks really similar to the Mysterious Letter's! 
    Penne: I should definitely confront Nero about this.
